# Flask

## Introduction

In this assignment you will create a flask application based on your capstone project. This is an open-ended continuation of your work that you are encouraged to continue past this assignment; the steps below are recommendation. All work should be done in the repository for your capstone project, not here.

## Basic

### Part 1: Build a simple flask app

1. Create a directory called `app`  containing a `.py` file with a flask application. It should have a route for `/`  that  returns a minimal HTML page from the `templates` directory using `render_template`. Run the app and verify it works.

2. Add some content to the HTML relevant to your capstone. Add a title, headers, some text about your project, and an image (located in the `static` directory).

### Part 2: Plan your app

1. Choose something interactive from your project. If you wrote a predictive model, the input might be a data point and the output a target or probability of a label. If it classifies images, imagine inputting an image and returning a label. Recommenders should recommend based on inputs.

Now take whatever idea you had and make it a lot simpler. Find the simplest possible way that you can connect your project to the application.

2. If your simplified plan has input fields, add these to your template, giving them `id` attributes. If it has outputs, add tags for those. Add a submit button.
